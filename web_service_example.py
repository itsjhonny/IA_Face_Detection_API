# This is a _very simple_ example of a web service that recognizes faces in uploaded images.
# Upload an image file and it will check if the image contains a picture of Barack Obama.
# The result is returned as json. For example:
#
# $ curl -XPOST -F "file=@obama2.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5001
#
# Returns:
#
# {
#  "face_found_in_image": true,
#  "is_picture_of_obama": true
# }
#
# This example is based on the Flask file upload example: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fileuploads/

# NOTE: This example requires flask to be installed! You can install it with pip:
# $ pip3 install flask
